This is our update on README.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

### This is my Markdown practice

*First commit

*Second commit

*Third commit

*Fourth commit

# Code example

```ruby
def new_code
puts"Hello"
end

```
